# [TgIntegration 1.0 Stable Release (v1.0)](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/releases/tag/v1.0) - 19 Oct 2020

After two years of neglect, _tgintegration_ is finally back!
With Pyrogram turning `asyncio`-native and a huge demand in proper testing capabilities for Telegram Bots, it was time to give the library the love it deserves. Thus I hereby present to you the initial 1.0 Release - async by default, fully capable, and well-tested.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Write **realtime integration tests** to ensure that your bot works as expected! ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Pytest examples](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/tree/master/examples/pytest)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Automate any interaction** on Telegram! ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Automation examples](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/tree/master/examples/automation)
